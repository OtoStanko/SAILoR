Data preprocessing:
	- calculateTPM: converts CPM from cp,_updated to TPM based on raw counts (raw_corrected_counts_filtered_updated.txt), fragement lengths (fragment_lengths.txt) and transcripts lengths (FlyBase_transcripts.fasta)    

	- getFFGeneNames.py: writes unique gene names from NetREX_female_prediciton_ranks_full.txt to NetREX_female_prediciton_ranks_full_names.txt and creates file name with transcription factors NetREX_female_prediciton_ranks_TFs_names.txt 
	- https://www.biotools.fr/drosophila/fbgn_converter was used to get FlyBase IDs, IDs are in NetREX_female_prediciton_ranks_full_names_ids.txt 
	- getMissingFoundIDs.py: stores found IDs to file found.txt and missing IDs to missing.txt
	- IDs from missing.txt are obtained with https://flybase.org/batchdownload, data is in NetREX_female_prediciton_ranks_full_names_ids_validation_table.txt with duplicates
	- removeDuplicateIDs.py: removes conflict genes and appends IDs to found.txt   
	- getIntersect.py: removes TFs not in found.txt and in raw_corrected_counts_filtered_updated and creates files genes.txt and TFs.txt 
	- filterTimeSeries.py: extracts final CPMs and TPMs for each experiment (tpm_S.txt, tpm_V.txt, tpm_C.txt, cpm_S.txt, cpm_V.txt, cpm_C.txt) 
	- interpolate.py interpolates time series to 0.5h intervals    

To convert CPM (Count per million) numbers to TPM (transcripts per million) we obtained number of reads N from the raw gene count and CPM values, 
average fragment length was obtained from Sequence Read Archive, average gene-transcript length was obtained from exon counts and exon lengths obtained from FlyBase sequence downloader https://flybase.org/download/sequence/batch/
